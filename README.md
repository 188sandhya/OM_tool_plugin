# OMA Tool

The OMA Tool allows easy definition and tracking of clear and meaningful objective metrics. Those metrics remove the politics from negotiations between the business, operations and the product developers when deciding how much risk to allow. It (tool) integrates with leading monitoring/logging solutions eliminating costly re-engineering of the application. Backed by rock-solid technology, the core of the system is built upon proven Open Source software.
